Challenge
Given today’s rising transportation challenges with pandemics, inflation, fuel costs, labor
shortage, customer expectations and environmental impact awareness, the need to fully utilize
shipment capacity is becoming a strategic necessity.
Modern supply chains must maximize whatever shipping mode is available to meet the
demands of their customer while minimizing transportation costs, but much of the industry
does not utilize efficient planning tools which leaves their shipments only partially full. This is a
problem called "paying to ship air".
Your Mission (…should you choose to accept it…) is to develop a model that will optimize usage
of the available space of a container given the cubic space and the items needing to be
shipped.
Examples of a Container Space To Optimize
Box Truck
24ft Length, 8ft High and 8ft wide. Max Weight 26,000 pounds.
Shipping Container
40ft Length, 8’6” high and 8ft wide. Max Weight 59,200 Pounds (also 10ft & 20ft Length).
Storage Unit
20ft Length, 8ft high and 10ft wide.
Pallets (Fit inside containers)
48” length, 5ft high and 40” wide. Max Weight 4,600 pounds.
Sample Products
Filters, Brake Pads, Windshield Wipers, Oil, Car Batteries, Rotors, Fuzzy Dice, etc.
Other Variables to Consider
Pack Size, Max Stacking Height, Handling, Max Weight Capacity, Hazardous Materials, etc.
Bonus (5%)
To avoid ordering too much inventory, companies look at the “Lead Time” and “Sales Forecast”
to decide how much of the product to order for a specific period. Given the desire to also
Optimize how much inventory you order, what strategies would you build into your model to
avoid ordering too much product when trying to maximize space utilization.
